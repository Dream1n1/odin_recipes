    <h1>Moroccan Tagine</h1>
    <img src="./moroccan-tagine.jpg" alt="Moroccan Tagine">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic dish, this Moroccan chicken recipe uses preserved lemons, olives, and onions. It can be cooked in an authentic tagine or roasted in the oven, depending on your preference, and what equipment you have at your disposal. Either way, you'll enjoy a delicious meal that is sure to please everyone at the dinner table. </p>
    <p>To the unfamiliar, tagine can be a little confusing, because it's both the name of the dish, and the vessel in which the dish is cooked. Typically made of clay or ceramic, the tagine is used in northern African cuisine, and it is distinguished by its wide, circular base and a cone-shaped top. The tagine functions like a slow cooker in a sense, and the cone shape functions as a way to return moisture to the base of the tagine, creating a moist and flavorful dish. </p>
